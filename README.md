A first-person dungeon exploration and puzzle game built with Unreal Engine 5. Navigate through ancient crypts, solve environmental puzzles, and uncover hidden treasures in this atmospheric adventure game.

##  Overview

[Crypt Raider is a 3D puzzle-adventure game](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=ue*79h9bSBU&ranSiteID=ue.79h9bSBU-P0zS7._gOTrh3wbPXDe.fw&LSNPUBID=ue*79h9bSBU&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads) where players explore mysterious underground crypts filled with ancient mechanisms, hidden passages, and challenging puzzles. This project demonstrates core Unreal Engine 5 features including physics simulation, lighting systems, and C++ gameplay programming.

##  Features

### Core Gameplay
- **First-Person Exploration**: Immersive first-person perspective with smooth character movement
- **Physics-Based Puzzles**: Interactive objects using Unreal Engine's physics system
- **Grabber Mechanic**: Pick up and manipulate objects to solve puzzles
- **Pressure Plate System**: Activate ancient mechanisms by placing objects on pressure plates
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Atmospheric torch lighting and dynamic shadows
- **Secret Areas**: Hidden rooms and passages to discover

### Technical Features
- **C++ Gameplay Programming**: Core mechanics implemented in C++
- **Blueprint Visual Scripting**: Level-specific logic and interactions
- **Modular Level Design**: Reusable dungeon components for easy level creation
- **Audio System**: Ambient sounds and interactive audio feedback
- **Particle Effects**: Dust particles, torch flames, and atmospheric effects

##  Prerequisites

- **Unreal Engine 5.3+** (or latest version)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (for C++ development)
- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Minimum 8GB RAM** (16GB recommended)
- **DirectX 12 compatible GPU**

##  Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jiayaozhang/UE5_CPP_Developer_Make_Video_Games.git
   cd crypt-raider
   ```

2. **Generate Visual Studio project files**
   - Right-click on `CryptRaider.uproject`
   - Select "Generate Visual Studio project files"

3. **Open the project**
   - Double-click `CryptRaider.uproject` to open in Unreal Engine
   - Or open `CryptRaider.sln` in Visual Studio for C++ development

4. **Build the project**
   - In Unreal Engine: Click "Compile" button
   - In Visual Studio: Build â†’ Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)

## Controls

| Action | Key/Button |
|--------|------------|
| Move Forward/Backward | W/S |
| Strafe Left/Right | A/D |
| Look Around | Mouse Movement |
| Jump | Spacebar |
| Grab/Release Object | E / Left Mouse Button |
| Sprint | Left Shift |
| Pause Menu | Escape |

## Game Mechanics

### Grabber System
- Point at objects and press **E** to grab
- Move grabbed objects with mouse movement
- Release objects to drop them or place on pressure plates
- Limited grab distance for realistic interaction

### Pressure Plates
- Require specific weight to activate
- Can trigger doors, bridges, or reveal secret passages
- Some plates require multiple objects or specific items

### Puzzle Types
1. **Weight Puzzles**: Find and place objects on pressure plates
2. **Sequence Puzzles**: Activate mechanisms in correct order
3. **Hidden Object Puzzles**: Locate secret items to progress
4. **Environmental Puzzles**: Use physics to overcome obstacles
